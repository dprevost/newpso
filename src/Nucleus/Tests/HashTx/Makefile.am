# The two "real" regression tests are ListTestSmall and ListTestBig.
# I put them at the end to make sure that the interface itself (to 
# the list) is ok. I also put Small before Big since the smaller one
# is doing a lot less iterations but doing many more consistency checks
# (I could have bundled it all together but the test would take too
# much clock time/cpu time).
